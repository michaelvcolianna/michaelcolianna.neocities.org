<p>Welcome to my site! It is a work in progress so please excuse our dust!</p>

<p><strong>YES, that's right, kids:</strong> My site has officially gone "old school". Now if I could just get the Sugar Hill Gang over here, maybe I could be "hip-hop" as well? Time to keep dreaming.</p>

<p>This site probably looks best in Internet Explorer. (Kidding.)</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get in touch with me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email: <strong>info@mvc.ink</strong></li>
  <li>ICQ: <strong>7029668</strong> (found it in an old notebook, but ICQ is gone)</li>
  <li>AOL Instant Messenger: <strong>MekinWakko</strong> (true facts from back in the day!)</li>
  <li>Bluesky: <a class="bold" href="https://bsky.app/profile/mvc.ink" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mvc.ink</a></li>
</ul>
