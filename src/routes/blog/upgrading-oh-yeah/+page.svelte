  This is a short post but with super cool news: I became a supporter on
  Neocities, so now my custom domain points here. Instead of <code
    >https://michaelcolianna.neocities.org</code
  >
  you can just go right to <code>https://mvc.ink</code>!
</p>

<p>
  I also added a link to the FCoE appendix on the <a href="/stories"
    >stories page</a
  >!
