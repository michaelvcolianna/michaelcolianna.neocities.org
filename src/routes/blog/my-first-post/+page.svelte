<h1>My first blog post</h1>

<BlogDate date="2025-01-17" />

<p>A few days ago, <ExternalLink href="https://bsky.app/profile/runwithskizzers.bsky.social">Preeti Chhibber</ExternalLink> discovered <ExternalLink href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</ExternalLink>.</p>

<p>She made a "fan page" for her book in the style of old Geocities pages from the 90's and early 00's.</p>

<p>Several other writing folks jumped into the fray and I was one of them. I originally dug up a "design" of mine from ages ago and used that, but it didn't have that Geocities look and feel. So I've redone it to make it fit that aesthetic AND I've added this blog!</p>

<p>Let me be clear: Despite some of the icons below, this is <u>not</u> made in Notepad and <u>doesn't</u> use QuickTime. My best guess is that this probably doesn't render well in Internet Explorer <u>OR</u> Netscape Navigator.</p>

<p>Because I'm a web developer in addition to being a writer, I actually build this locally using SvelteKit. You can actually <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/michaelvcolianna/michaelcolianna.neocities.org">view the repository</ExternalLink> with the code!</p>
